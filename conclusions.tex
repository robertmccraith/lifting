\section{Conclusions}\label{s:conclusions}

In this paper we presented a novel method of localising 3D objects in LiDAR point clouds, trained using only generic 2D object detector. Compared to previous work, our method is less complex, we do not require the use of additional manually annotated data sources as in \cite{qin20weakly} or virtual data and ground truth 2D bounding boxes as in \cite{zakharov20autolabeling}, and we still achieve superior accuracy and better run time. To our knowledge, our method is the first method that can learn to transform 2D predictions to 3D detections without any need for supervision of 3D parameters.
