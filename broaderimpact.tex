\section{Broader impact}\label{s:broaderimpact}

The main application of our proposed method is in the field of autonomous driving. The safety critical nature of this field imposes strict requirements on robustness of the applied algorithms. We envision two ways our work can have a potential impact. First of all, since a perception system of an autonomous vehicle must operate reliably in diverse conditions it needs to cover the long tails of possible scenarios encountered on the road. In other words, it must not fail even in situations that occur extremely rarely. This requires large annotated datasets to train the object detection systems on and our algorithm capable of learning without labeled data can facilitate that. On the other hand, learning from raw unlabeled data without human curation may introduce subtle errors and extreme care must be taken before adopting algorithms such as ours in life-critical applications. For example, in fig.~\ref{f:Qualitative} a reflection of a car is detected and a 3D bounding box is predicted even though a human annotator would obviously not label this case. We hope that future research will address these concerns.
